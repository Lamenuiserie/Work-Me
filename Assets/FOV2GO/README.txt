Stereoskopix FOV2GO for Unity allows you to create and play Unity games in full stereo 3D. It supports nearly any kind of stereo 3D display system (with the exception of time-interleaved [field-sequential] display), including side-by-side and anaglyph display. It works on desktop, web and mobile. Now making a stereoscopic game can be as simple as dropping a script onto your camera and setting a few parameters. Stereoskopix FOV2GO for Unity also has extensive capabilities as a component of a virtual reality system, using smartphones and tablets enclosed in a FOV2GO (or other) stereoscope.Please direct any bugs/comments/suggestions to Perry Hoberman <hoberman@usc.edu>FOV2GO is a hardware and software kit for the creation of immersive virtual reality experiences using smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. It?s an emerging platform for dirt-cheap, world-class virtual reality. The smart phone in your pocket (and the tablet in your backpack) has everything it needs to become a low cost, state-of-the-art virtual reality device.  All the components for creating fully immersive virtual worlds have suddenly become ubiquitous and cheap. The only thing lacking is a kit that puts all the pieces together - so we built one. We want to see virtual reality finally develop to its true potential as an artistic medium - and so we're making these tools available to artists and designers everywhere.  The MxR Lab at USC is making everything you need to get started freely available: plans, instructions, links & software. Visit http://diy.mxrlab.com for more information, documentation, etc.FOV2GO viewers and applications are currently being developed for games, training, visualization, art and social media. You can find FOV2GO apps at the iTunes App store and the Android Market. Just search for FOV2GO,The MxR Lab at USC provides templates and instructions for making your own FOV2GO viewer for your iOS or Android phone or tablet. Templates and instructions are included in this package (inside the Documentation folder), and are also available at http://diy.mxrlab.com.
